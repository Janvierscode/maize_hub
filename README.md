# 🌽 Maize Hub - Your Corn's Best Friend

> _Because even corn deserves a social network!_

A Flutter-powered mobile application for maize leaf disease classification and farmer communication. Built with ❤️ for my thesis (and for corn farmers everywhere).

## 🚀 What This App Does

- **🔍 Disease Detection**: Snap a photo of your maize leaves and let AI tell you what's wrong (spoiler: it's probably not good news)
- **💬 Farmer Chat**: Connect with fellow farmers who understand your corn struggles
- **📱 Real-time Messaging**: Because crop emergencies don't wait for business hours
- **🌱 Expert Advice**: Get professional guidance for your maize management

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter (because cross-platform is life)
- **Backend**: Firebase (Google's gift to lazy developers)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Database**: Cloud Firestore
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage
- **Messaging**: Firebase Cloud Messaging
- **AI/ML**: _[Your ML model here]_

## 📱 Features

### 🎯 Core Features

- **Smart Disease Classification**: Upload images and get instant disease diagnosis
- **Live Chat System**: Real-time messaging with read receipts and online status
- **User Authentication**: Secure login/signup with profile management
- **Push Notifications**: Never miss important farming updates

### 🌟 Chat Features (Because Farmers Need to Talk Too)

- ✅ Real-time messaging
- 📖 Read receipts (seen, delivered, read)
- 🟢 Online/offline status indicators
- ⏰ Smart timestamps ("Just now", "5m ago", etc.)
- 📸 Image sharing for crop discussions

## 🎓 Academic Context

This project is part of my thesis research on **"AI-Powered Agricultural Solutions for Sustainable Farming"** (or something equally impressive that sounds good in academic circles).

### Research Objectives

1. Develop an accessible mobile platform for crop disease identification
2. Create a communication network for agricultural knowledge sharing
3. Improve farming productivity through technology integration
4. Prove that developers can actually help save the world (one corn at a time)

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Firebase account (free tier is your friend)
- Android Studio or VS Code
- A decent internet connection
- Patience (lots of it)

### Installation

1. **Clone this repo** (you know the drill)

   ```bash
   git clone [your-repo-url]
   cd maize_hub
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (grab a coffee, this might take a while)

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Firebase Setup** (the fun part)

   - Create a new Firebase project
   - Enable Authentication, Firestore, and Storage
   - Download `google-services.json` and place it in `android/app/`
   - Update `lib/firebase_options.dart` with your config

4. **Run the app** (fingers crossed)
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## 📊 Project Status

- ✅ Basic authentication system
- ✅ Real-time chat functionality
- ✅ User profile management
- ✅ Firebase integration
- 🔄 Disease classification model (work in progress)
- 🔄 Advanced crop management features
- ⏳ Thesis writing (the real challenge)

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Sometimes the chat gets a bit too chatty (we're working on it)
- The AI might occasionally mistake a healthy leaf for a diseased one (still learning)
- UI might look different on various devices (welcome to mobile development)
